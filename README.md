- `BPM_Boxplot_Modified.png`: Modified version of the BPM boxplot.
- `Mapa_Korelacji.png`: Correlation map.
- `mlp_project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the main project code.
- `PCA_Scatter_Modified.png`: Modified scatter plot using PCA.
- `PCA_Scattert.png`: Original scatter plot using PCA.
- `tSNE.png`: t-SNE visualization.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `mlp_project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to explore the code and results.

## Requirements
